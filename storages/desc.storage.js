    "It's urgent, but we don't have time in the next two years to test it, but we must prioritize it. At least we don't need to obfuscate it. You must rethink the whole process. We will give you a slice of pizza if you finish the code until yesterday. Make it pop remember, the entirety is equal or better.  We must build a queue system to ensure it gets the data from our API so this will result in a delay. How does this indicator should look? Also please answer to question from the next mail. Kind reminder. Please inform us where we are on this. After the release, we will need to test it individually. This was the last time when you are allowed to promote something urgent in the production when you was asked for.",
    "Dropping the production database is the best coffee in the morning. Also, if you don't have a backup it will work well. We donâ€™t want a backup, it in no way is going down! We must start to do it in this way. Did you develop on production code using the UAT Database?  This is the method that we choose. I don't believe we talked about the same thing. We must check Jira and you must put everything there, even tasks that you didn't do. We exceed the client's expectancies, but he fired us.  Put everything on git. Why this password is encrypted, how I can use it? We will not update any information received from you, so you will be the master of the data. Please create an extra line in the source code file with a comment contends.",
    "The most important part of the workday is lunchtime. I don't see your task in Jira so that means you didn't work in this sprint. Can we attempt some other colors maybe just do what you think? I agree with you, yet desires to be smoother can you are making it appear like this clipart I created nor are we able to have any other option, for making it look like Spotify, or I want you to take it to the next level. I don't believe that you did some unit tests.  Send me the password in plain text on email. Hurry up! Let's do the Secret Santa Party in November.  The client said that he just want a website to generate data, nothing more, now he told us what he means is a website like Facebook. ",
    "We will have another meeting to be sure that you understand what I talked about in the last meeting. And after that, we will do a Knowledge Share to be sure that everyone understands. We appreciate your great effort, but you must follow the rules.  I know anyone who can do that for an affordable cost, but I have a remarkable concept for a startup, I want you to construct it for me yet can you transform to make the pizza look more delicious, or needs to be sleeker. Yes, you can store the passwords in a sticky note on your screen, because nobody knows your password. We will update the data that we receive from you. I do not if the API planned does support updates as well. If not, it should be considered. ",
    "I think there might be confusion about the guidelines. Please see my answers below.  Currently, we set up the logic of the pipeline like this: eat pizza, drink coffee, bathroom, two lines of code, repeat the process.  Currently, we sum these permissions.  Is it not enough to put the header with the name of the field on the first row? Please don't reply, please. It is crucial that we get the app up and running asap. I modified the application and itâ€™s working now, but you must include a new feature to the app.  I do not recommend any hardcoding of special parameters in the database, I suggest to do it the code to be faster. In my understanding this is a special flag for a company, telling us if they provide or not support servic.",
    "It's not a bug, it's working only in some cases because we want to be sure that it's a real person, not a computer. In the following days, we will create an atmosphere for us to grow so we will use the current environment only for the alliance with you. Here's the client application configured to your test customer. I think this new service can be a good alternative in this case. I responded with comments for the question regarding the Secret Santa Party. Please respond again. I hope it helps â€“ if NOT please lets make a conf call on WED â€¦ This will help us more to understand how things work. This is a platform for business oriented characters. ",
    "We start the release, but currently, we have some issues regarding the release. This approach would make many exceptions in a short time, that would made the entire system exposed. I added new comments with red about the team building. Nobody it's allowed to look at his boss. We also can follow Figure 2â€“ the last question: from where do we estimate the listed %stages from? A public we server is the component that should be defended the best from the external world.  We must move quickly because it's lunchtime. Meeting notes: we ate this and that. I understand your point regarding data duplication and deletion, but I will describe my concerns regarding this approach.",
    "Let's create a calendar to know everything, from brithdays to releases date, because everyone wants to know when to don't bring food and when to be sick. Today, we release most of the APIs that we planned in the sprint planning and I will describe changes that have an impact on you. I will send you an email when is on the ST environment. Ok, we will do something like this. The clinet will have to register his account twice on the website to give him the chance to learn the application.  Data protection laws are usually relevant in case any processing of private information is concerned.",

    "April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices. She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon sleeping with her every night?",
    "Patrick didn't want to go. The fact that she was insisting they must go made him want to go even less. He had no desire to make small talk with strangers he would never again see just to be polite. But she insisted that Patrick go, and she would soon find out that this would be the biggest mistake she could make in their relationship.",
    "My pincher collar is snapped on. Then comes the electric zapper collar. Finally, my purple at-home collar is taken off and I know Iâ€™m going for a walk to the dog park. Iâ€™m so excited to see my friends. I hope Spike or Thunder are there already. They're the most fun to chase and tumble with. My human is pretty strict with me. Iâ€™m only allowed on the grass and not on the sidewalks. I think sheâ€™s afraid Iâ€™m going to jump on the other humans. I donâ€™t understand why everyone else gets to jump on the benches and run wild on the sidewalks. They donâ€™t listen to their humans. I know I could ignore mine but if I do she may zap me and itâ€™s just not worth it. She probably wouldnâ€™t let me back at the dog park if I didnâ€™t listen to her. I just love the dog park.",
    "They told her that this was her once chance to show the world what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had told her that you don't show the world what you're made of when they are all watching, you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. It was looking more and more like her brother was correct.",
    "The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.",
    "He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate. He couldn't be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it was a long time. Much too long.",
    "It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.",
    "It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next",
    "I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction.",
    "A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different. The first snow of the year brought back the witches as the fairies in the yard had to seek shelter to avoid the cold.",
    "He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.",
    "The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination. While people may have called it a 'bridge', the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes. It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it.",
    "Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper. There was room for five more stars but they would be difficult ones to earn. It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were considered the 'easy' ones.",
    "Her hair was a tangled mess which she tried to make presentable by putting in a lump on the top of her head. It didn't really work although it was a valiant attempt. While most people simply noticed the tangled mess on top of her head, what most people failed to understand that within the tangles mess was an entirely new year. That was her secret. She kept worlds on top of her head.",
    "Matt told her to reach for the stars, but Veronica thought it was the most ridiculous advice she'd ever received. Sure, it had been well-meaning when he said it, but she didn't understand why anyone would want to suggest something that would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it.",
    "The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that start.",
    "Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Sarah. She didn't have a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't even a note attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, but that wasn't the way Sarah did things. Now it was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose.",
    "Sometimes that's just the way it has to be. Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn't let them enter his mind. It was done and that was that. It was just the way it had to be.",
    "Frank knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his secret and this wasn't it. The issue was that the secret might be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. At this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant on those around him who also knew the secret. They wouldn't purposely reveal it, or at least he believed that, but they could easily inadvertently expose it. It was going to be a long hour as he nervously eyed everyone around the table hoping they would keep their mouths shut.",
    "She was infatuated with color. She didn't have a favorite color per se, but she did have a fondness for teals and sea greens. You could see it in the clothes she wore that color was an important part of her overall style. She took great pride that color flowed from her and that color was always all around her. That is why, she explained to her date sitting across the table, that she could never have a serious relationship with him due to the fact that he was colorblind.",
    "Brenda never wanted to be famous. While most of her friends dreamed about being famous, she could see the negative aspects that those who wanted to be famous seemed to ignore. The fact that you could never do anything in public without being mobbed and the complete lack of privacy was something that she never wanted to experience. She also had no desire to have strangers speculating about every aspect of her life and what each thing she did was supposed to mean. Brenda was perfectly happy with her anonymous life where she could do exactly as she wanted without anyone else giving a damn. Thus, her overnight Internet celebrity was not something she was thrilled about as her friends told her how lucky she was.",
    "Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.",
    "You can decide what you want to do in life, but I suggest doing something that creates. Something that leaves a tangible thing once you're done. That way even after you're gone, you will still live on in the things you created.",
    "There were a variety of ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his. He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past. So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game.",
    "Finding the truth wouldn't be easy, that's for sure. Then there was the question of whether or not Jane really wanted to know the truth. That's the thing that bothered her most. It wasn't the difficulty of actually finding out what happened that was the obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found.",
    "There was only one way to do things in the Statton house. That one way was to do exactly what the father, Charlie, demanded. He made the decisions and everyone else followed without question. That was until today.",
    "Barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes. it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes. David had promised that he would be on time today. He never was, but he had promised this one time. She had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until she'd believed his promise. Now she was paying the price.",
    "It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality, it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation.",
    "Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She couldn't take her eyes off the water swirling around and around. She stuck in small twigs and leaves to watch the whirlpool catch them and then suck them down. It bothered her more than a little bit that this could also be used as a metaphor for her life.",
    "Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?",
    "You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don't believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how I know, but I just do.",
    "Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sunâ€™s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.",
    "The blinking light caught her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn't remember ever noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had failed to notice.",
    "Terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to stay out of it. He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. He knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved. It was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. He kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face.",
    "Where do they get a random paragraph?' he wondered as he clicked the generate button. Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same.",
    "Bryan had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. This had made all the difference in the world. Being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend the rest of his life alone in a cell.",
    "All he could think about was how it would all end. There was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.",
    "'It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing,' he said. 'This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get together and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee,' he continued, laying the trap he'd been planning for years.",
    "They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know yourself better than those around you. Derick knew nothing about this. He thought he had found peace but this was an illusion as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that he actually knew nothing about himself.",
    "'Do Not Enter.' The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. That wasn't going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion that signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. That's why the moment Jack looked at the 'Do Not Enter' sign, he walked past it and onto their property.",
    "She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.",
    "There was a time in his life when her rudeness would have set him over the edge. He would have raised his voice and demanded to speak to the manager. That was no longer the case. He barely reacted at all, letting the rudeness melt away without saying a word back to her. He had been around long enough to know where rudeness came from and how unhappy the person must be to act in that way. All he could do was feel pity and be happy that he didn't feel the way she did to lash out like that.",
    "Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.",
    "Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place for you.",
    "The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate.",
    "It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary about it or so it seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing it was there, let alone what the actual color of it was. It was due to this common and unassuming appearance that few people actually stopped to sit in it and discover its magical powers.",
    "Was it a whisper or was it the wind? He wasn't quite sure. He thought he heard a voice but at this moment all he could hear was the wind rustling the leaves of the trees all around him. He stopped and listened more intently to see if he could hear the voice again. Nothing but the wind rustling the leaves could be heard. He was about to continue his walk when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and he quickly turned to see who it was. There was nobody there, but he heard the voice again.",
    "He heard the song coming from a distance, lightly floating over the air to his ears. Although it was soft and calming, he was wary. It seemed a little too soft and a little too calming for everything that was going on.
